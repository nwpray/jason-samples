    <h3><a ng-href="/modal_sample">Modal Sample</a></h3>
    <p><strong>A custom modal directive that allows you to more easily create and control your modals in a more angular-ish way.</strong></p>
    <p>
        The directive takes three attribute arguments: a template view url, a controller reference and an alias. The
        directive then loads the view into itself and binds its own controller to the controller passed as an argument.
        The modal can then be referenced from the passed controller by the alias if it was specified or just Modal if
        it was specified. The controller comes with built in observable/event functionality so that the parent controller
        can subscribe to built in events or ones created within the passed view. There is also a built in timer.

    <h3><a ng-href="/loading_sample">Loading Sample</a></h3>
    <p><strong>This is a directive, service pair that allows access to a loading modal/spinner to any controller that injects the service</strong></p>
    <p>
        The directive component of this takes a template view url to any custom spinner and essentially creates an interface
        that can be used by the service to communicate with the spinner. The service allows any component that injects it into
        their scope manipulate the loading modal.

    <p><strong>These are the three single web page samples I submitted as concept of design for the company I am freelancing for</strong></p>
    <p>
        These pages were basically just css and js sugar to show my client what was possible. They are by no means responsive or complete.
        I included these to show you some of the more visually pleasing css/html skills I have. There are some css and js animations hidden
        throughout the pages just to make it feel more alive. Things like button and image hover will activate most of the animations. Other than
        the images and some icons from semantic-ui, I built all these components from scratch. There are probably a few bugs because I pretty much
        grabbed these as full pages and slammed them into the angular view with a few minor fixes to account for not having their own body element.
